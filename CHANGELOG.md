## Unreleased

### Added

* Support for tags.
    * Many tag flavors are supported: `#hashtags`, `:colon:separated:tags:` and even Bear's [`#multi-word tags#`](https://blog.bear.app/2017/11/bear-tips-how-to-create-multi-word-tags/). If you prefer to use a YAML frontmatter, list your tags with the keys `tags` or `keywords`.
